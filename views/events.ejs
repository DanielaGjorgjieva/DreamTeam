            <h1>about Basketball</h1>
            <p class="about">
                Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another
                on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4
                inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted
                10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from
                shooting through their own hoop.
                A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.
                After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given
                one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but
                if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
