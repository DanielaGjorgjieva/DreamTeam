Type of objects:

Event:
{
    sport : "",
    owner : "",
    description : "",
    place : "",
    date : "",        #stating date
    frequency : "",
    max_members : 10,
    members : [],
    chat : "";
}

User:
{
    username: "",
    password: "",
    created: [],
    joined: [],
}

Idea:
we can add in the aside bar a list of people that is online right now
and in the aside bar of the specific event, a list of online and offline users
